*Last Updated: December 2024*

## Overview

What's It Worth is an item valuation tool that runs entirely in your browser within ChatGPT. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

## Data Processing

All item valuation is performed:

## Data Storage

- **Browser LocalStorage**: Your item details may be cached in your browser's localStorage for convenience (30-day expiration). This data never leaves your device.
- **Server Logs**: Anonymous analytics are logged for up to 30 days for service improvement.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes. Anonymous, aggregated analytics may be used to improve the service.

## Your Rights

You can:
- Clear your browser's localStorage at any time to remove cached data
